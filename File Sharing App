Design a system that allows users to share files with each other.
Users are allowed to upload files and share with others through a link. The users who open the link cannot download the file.

Twists:
1. What do we do if the file is larger than capacity on a single node?
2. What if one node goes down or a single disk is broken?
3. How do we balance free space between the nodes?
4. We can offer free and premium services, each with different storage limits.
5. We can introduce monthly fees according to the capacity used.

Key areas to look: implementation of index, capacity usage, risk of losing a file, distribution of data within the system, security and permissions.
